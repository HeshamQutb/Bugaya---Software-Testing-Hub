# 🐞 Bugaya - Software Testing Hub  

Welcome to **Bugaya**, a creative project built during our **Intensive Code Camp Program (ITI)** journey.  
This project was developed by **Hesham Qutb** and **Mina Khalifa** as part of our **Web Fundamentals track** after we had just learned the basics of **HTML** and **CSS**.  

Since we were studying the **Software Testing track**, we thought:  
_"Why not build something that actually connects to what we are learning?"_  
And from there, **Bugaya - Software Testing Hub** was born 🚀.

## 🌟 Project Idea  

The idea behind Bugaya is simple yet powerful:  
- A **website dedicated to software testing**.  
- A space that reflects our learning process, creativity, and technical skills.  
- A first milestone project where we turned theory into practice.  

The name **"Bugaya"** is inspired by the word **"Bug"** 🐞, which is the soul of software testing.  
We wanted the project to carry both **fun vibes** and a **serious purpose** at the same time.

## 🎯 Objectives  

- ✅ Apply what we learned in **HTML & CSS** into a real project.  
- ✅ Build a website with a **clear theme** (software testing).  
- ✅ Learn how to collaborate as a team and use tools like **Git & GitHub**.  
- ✅ Show our creativity while staying within the scope of our early learning stage.

## 💡 Features  

- **Clean, simple design** built purely with **HTML & CSS**.  
- **Theme-focused** content related to **software testing**.  
- **Collaborative effort** between two ITI trainees.  
- Acts as our **first step** into the world of real web development projects.

## 👨‍💻 Developers  

- **Hesham Qutb** – Flutter Developer & Software Testing Enthusiast  
- **Mina Khalifa** – Software Testing Enthusiast  

Both of us combined our efforts to bring Bugaya to life, pushing ourselves beyond the classroom to create something that represents our journey.

## 📚 What We Learned  

During this project, we learned much more than just coding:  
- How to **think creatively** and align a project with our field (Software Testing).  
- How to **use Git and GitHub** to collaborate and manage our code.  
- The importance of **planning, dividing tasks**, and merging everything into a final product.  
- How to **transform raw knowledge (HTML & CSS)** into something functional and presentable.

## 🌍 Live Demo  

(Coming Soon with **GitHub Pages**)  
We plan to make Bugaya live so anyone can explore our little hub of testing!  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  

This is only the beginning. We see **Bugaya** growing into something bigger in the future:  
- Adding **JavaScript** for interactivity.  
- Expanding content with **real testing concepts and tutorials**.  
- Making the website **responsive** and mobile-friendly.  
- Potentially evolving into a **mini testing community hub**.  

---

## 🎉 Final Words  

**Bugaya - Software Testing Hub** is not just a project…  
It is our **first step** in combining creativity, teamwork, and coding.  
It shows how we transformed the simplest tools (**HTML & CSS**) into a project that **reflects our passion for software testing**.  

We’re proud of what we built, and even more excited for what’s next! 💪🔥
